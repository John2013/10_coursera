# How to install

Python 3 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # alternatively try pip3
```

Remember, it is recommended to use [virtualenv/venv](https://devman.org/encyclopedia/pip/pip_virtualenv/) for better isolation.

# How to use

Example:
```bash
$ python coursera.py <result_file_path(default:'courses.xlsx')>
```

The process will take several tens of seconds.
